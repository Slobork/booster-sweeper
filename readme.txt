== Description ==
Booster Sweeper helps you to optimize the Website speed further over the common caching and minification plugins. <a href="https://maxpressy.com/booster-sweeper/asset-cleanup-wordpress-plugin-manager/?mtm_campaign=wpPluginPage&mtm_kwd=boostersweeper&mtm_placement=top" target="_blank">Booster Sweeper</a> allows you to dequeue assets, i.e. unload the unused CSS or JavaScript files.

You see, with the most of the WordPress plugins or even themes, most of the assets are loaded over the whole site, while usually you do not need those resources for certain pages. By unloading those files that aren't necessary you are reducing the overall size of the page and at the same time decreasing the number of http requests. This results in a better performance for the pages and, even if other things are configured well, in a better SEO score for your site.

== Booster Sweeper is simple to use ==
On each page or post of your WordPress site, from the sidebar settings, you'll be able to notice a Booster Sweeper section. Here, our plugin is automatically detecting the assets that are loaded on the page. CSS and JS files are separated with separated section and when you select a file it will be prevented from loading on the particular page.

== Go Premium Soon ==
Premium Version of Booster Sweeper allows you to dequeue assets in bulk, i.e. from the plugin global settings. Instead of doing it individually per page/post, you can select the pages and posts for which you wish certain CSS and JavaScript files that should be prevented from loading. But that's not all, Pro version gives you ability to control the appearance of the assets based on many conditions:
<ul>
 <li>Post types, e.g. Woocommerce</li>
 <li>Archives, i.e. categories, tags or even custom post types specific archive</li>
 <li>Specific pages, like Media files, search pages, 404</li>
 <li>By RegEx</li>
</ul>

To go further, with Booster Sweeper Pro, you can also manage the assets on the back-end side of the site. This may be specially important and beneficial for the membership sites.
